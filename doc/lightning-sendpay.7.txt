LIGHTNING-SENDPAY(7)
====================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-sendpay - Protocol for sending a payment via a route.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sendpay* 'route' 'hash'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *sendpay* RPC command attempts to send funds associated with the
given 'hash', along a route to the final destination in the route.

Generally, a client would call getroute(7) to resolve a route, then
use *sendpay* to send it.  If it fails, it would call getroute(7)
again to retry.

The response will occur when the payment fails or succeeds.  Once a
payment has succeeded, calls to *sendpay* with the same 'hash' will
fail; this prevents accidental multiple payments.

RETURN VALUE
------------

On success, a 'preimage' hex string is returned as proof that the
destination received the payment.  The 'preimage' will SHA256 to the
'hash' given by the caller.

On error, if the error occurred from a node other than the final
destination, the route table will be updated so that getroute(7)
should return an alternate route (if any).  An error from the final
destination implies the payment should not be retried.
